Linear Regression Applied to Swimming
===
- We will consider Exercise 9.1 in Hoff very closely to illustrate linear regression. 
- The data set we consider contains times (in seconds) of four high school swimmers swimming 50 yards. 
- There are 6 times for each student, taken every two weeks. 
- Each row corresponds to a swimmer and a higher column index indicates a later date. 

Data set
===

```{r}
read.table("https://www.stat.washington.edu/~pdhoff/Book/Data/hwdata/swim.dat",header=FALSE)
```

Full conditionals (Task 1)
===
We will fit a separate linear regression model for each swimmer, with swimming time as the response and week as the explanatory variable. Let $Y_{i}\in \mathbbm{R}^{6}$ be the 6 recorded times for swimmer $i.$ Let
\[X_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1  \\
    1 & 3 \\ 
    ... \\
    1 & 9\\
    1 & 11
\end{bmatrix}
\] be the design matrix for swimmer $i.$ Then we use the following linear regression model: 
\begin{align*}
    Y_i &\sim \mathcal{N}_6\left(X\beta_i, \tau_i^{-1}\mathcal{I}_6\right) \\
    \beta_i &\sim \mathcal{N}_2\left(\beta_0, \Sigma_0\right) \\
    \tau_i &\sim \text{Gamma}(a,b).
\end{align*}
Derive full conditionals for $\beta_i$ and $\tau_i.$ 

Solution (Task 1)
===
The conditional posterior for $\beta_i$ is multivariate normal with 
\begin{align*}
    \mathbbm{V}[\beta_i \, | \, Y_i, X_i, \textcolor{red}{\tau_i} ] &= (\Sigma_0^{-1} + \tau X_i^{T}X_i)^{-1}\\ 
    \mathbbm{E}[\beta_i \, | \, Y_i, X_i, \textcolor{red}{\tau_i} ] &= 
    (\Sigma_0^{-1} + \textcolor{red}{\tau_i} X_i^{T}X_i)^{-1} (\Sigma_0^{-1}\beta_0 + \textcolor{red}{\tau_i} X_i^{T}Y_i).
\end{align*} while
\begin{align*}
    \tau_i \, | \, Y_i, X_i, \beta &\sim \text{Gamma}\left(a + 3\, , \, b + \frac{(Y_i - X_i\beta_i)^{T}(Y_i - X_i\beta_i)}{2} \right).
\end{align*}

These can be found in in Hoff in section 9.2.1.

Task 2
===
Complete the prior specification by choosing $a,b,\beta_0,$ and $\Sigma_0.$ Let your choices be informed by the fact that times for this age group tend to be between 22 and 24 seconds. 

Solution (Task 2)
===
Choose $a=b=0.1$ so as to be somewhat uninformative. 

Choose $\beta_0 = [23\,\,\, 0]^{T}$ with 
\[\Sigma_0 =
\begin{bmatrix}
    5 & 0  \\
    0 & 2 
\end{bmatrix}.
\] This centers the intercept at 23 (the middle of the given range) and the slope at 0 (so we are assuming no increase) but we choose the variance to be a bit large to err on the side of being less informative.

Gibbs sampler (Task 3)
===
Code a Gibbs sampler to fit each of the models. For each swimmer $i,$ obtain draws from the posterior predictive distribution for $y_i^{*},$ the time of swimmer $i$ if they were to swim two weeks from the last recorded time.


 


Posterior Prediction (Task 4)
===
The coach has to decide which swimmer should compete in a meet two weeks from the last recorded time. Using the posterior predictive distributions, compute $\text{Pr}\left\{y_i^{*}=\text{max}\left(y_1^{*},y_2^{*},y_3^{*},y_4^{*}\right)\right\}$ for each swimmer $i$ and use these probabilities to make a recommendation to the coach. 

- This is left as an exercise.
