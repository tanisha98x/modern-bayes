\section{Agenda}

We can often end up with posterior distributions that we only know up to a normalizing constant. For example, in practice, we may derive $$p(\theta \mid x) \propto p(x\mid \theta) p(\theta)$$ and find that the normalizing constant $p(x)$ is very difficult to evaluate. Such examples occur when we start building non-conjugate models in Bayesian statistics. 

Given such a posterior, how can we appropriate it's density? One way is using rejection sampling. As an example, let's suppose our resulting posterior distribution is 
$$f(x) \propto sin^2(\pi x), x \in [0,1].$$

In order to understand how to approximate the density (normalized) of $f$, we will investigate the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Plot the densities of $f(x)$ and the Unif(0,1) on the same plot. 
\item According to the rejection sampling approach sample from $f(x)$ using the Unif(0,1) pdf as an enveloping function.
\item Plot a histogram of the points that fall in the acceptance region. Do this for a simulation size of $10^2$ and $10^5$ and report your acceptance ratio. Compare the ratios and histograms.
\item Repeat Tasks 1 - 3 for  Beta(2,2) as an enveloping function. 
\item Compare your results with the results in Task 3.
%\item Using importance sampling calculate the $\mathbb{E}(x)$, where $x \sim f(x)$ from previous task and the proposal distribution is transformed Beta(2,2). (This will be covered in more detail in lab.)
\end{enumerate}
